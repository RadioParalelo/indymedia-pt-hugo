This is a working backup of the main [indymedia.pt](https://indymedia.pt) website, for redundancy.

It is based on Hugo.
It uses the [AZ Indymedia theme](github.com/pgsimpso/az-indymedia-theme) for Hugo.
It's Hosted directly on github, and deployed through netlify.

The main features we want to develop further are:
- Automatic RSS import of posts from the RSS feed of the main site, for mantaining the backup operational.
- A native CMS for content submission.
