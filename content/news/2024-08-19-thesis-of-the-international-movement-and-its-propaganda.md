1. As We understand it, the dissemination of anarchist propaganda has endeavored a breakthrough with the hegemony of the English language in the West, and even in the East.

2. Therefore, unlike what some comrades claim, _indigeneity_ isn&#8217;t a quality to struggle that should be preserved in lieu of the actual exchange of ideas.

3. Especially when it comes to the developed world, with a colonial past, where the indigenous claim can&#8217;t be sustained for reasons that are obvious to all, not only should English be embraced, but it should actually overturn all other anarchist literature.

4. We are not linguists, preservation does not interest us in the slightest when it comes to the urgency of our daily needs. Including the security culture where a language barrier will preserve our chosen authors.

5. All literature of an anarchist variety, or with an anarchic streak, that aspires to that tacky originality of colloquial speech, shouldn&#8217;t be upheld by any serious comrade. It should either be buried deep within the leaves of the Earth, or lifted to the abhorrent mainstream it sprung from.

6. The respectability of one&#8217;s standing, and of the stances of all, is the measure of its legitimacy. And, although that can change over time, therein lies the discourse battle to be fought, which shall be won be us.

7. Long live the anarchist canon.
