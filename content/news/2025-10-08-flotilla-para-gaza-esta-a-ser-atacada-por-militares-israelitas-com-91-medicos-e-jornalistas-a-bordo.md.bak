FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Israeli Military Attacks Flotilla in International Waters 120 Nautical Miles (220km) from Gaza

8 October 2025 – The Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC) and Thousand Madleens to Gaza (TMTG) confirm that three boat : Gaza Sunbirds, Alaa Al-Najajr, Anas Al-Sharif, have been attacked and illegally intercepted by the Israeli military at 04:34 at 120 nautical miles (220km) from Gaza.

Sources so far indicate that the unarmed crew aboard, including doctors, journalists, and elected officials, have been abducted, as well as the vital aid worth over $110,000 USD in medicines, respiratory equipment, and nutritional supplies that were destined for Gaza’s starving hospitals. Their whereabouts remain unknown.

“Israel has no legal authority to detain international volunteers aboard these ships,” David Heap, Canadian Boat to Gaza and Freedom Flotilla Coalition Steering Committee. “This seizure blatantly violates international law and defies the ICJ’s binding orders requiring unimpeded humanitarian access to Gaza. Our volunteers are not subject to Israeli jurisdiction and cannot be criminalized for delivering aid or challenging an illegal blockade. Their detention is arbitrary, unlawful, and must end immediately.”

This assault follows the illegal seizure and unlawful detention of those on the Global Sumud Flotilla, Handala, and Madleen, as well as the Israeli drone attack on the Conscience in European waters earlier this year, which left the vessel disabled and burning. These repeated attacks on unarmed civilians demonstrate Israel’s deliberate escalation and the total failure of governments to enforce international law.

Israel continues to act with total impunity. It has defied the International Court of Justice’s binding orders to allow unimpeded humanitarian access to Gaza, disregarded international law protecting civilian navigation, and dismissed the demands of millions worldwide calling for an end to the illegal siege and genocide.

The FFC and TMTG demand:

An end to Israel’s illegal and deadly blockade of Gaza;  
An end to Israel’s genocide of Gaza;  
The immediate release of all abducted volunteers;  
The immediate delivery of humanitarian aid directly to Palestinians, independent of Israeli control;  
Full accountability for the military assaults on our flotilla boats.

Update – October 8, 2025 – 5:35 a.m.

In one hour, eight boats were intercepted by the Israeli army : Abd Elkarim Eid, Alaa Al-Najar, Anas Al-Sharif, Gaza Sunbird, Leïla Khaled, Milad, Soul of My Soul, and Um Saad.  
Only the Conscience is still sailing as it is attacked by an Israeli military helicopter.
