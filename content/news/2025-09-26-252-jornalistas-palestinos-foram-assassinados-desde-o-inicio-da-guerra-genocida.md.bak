Esse número é quase quatro vezes maior do que, somados, os números de jornalistas mortos na Primeira e Segunda Guerra Mundial – ao todo, 69 profissionais de imprensa foram vitimados nos dois conflitos. Além disso, nos últimos dois anos, 400 profissionais de imprensa palestinos ficaram feridos e outros 647 tiveram suas casas completamente destruídas. A informação do sindicato é que 34 jornalistas foram assassinados diante de suas famílias. Aqueles que perderam suas casas, hoje vivem em tendas improvisadas. Desde o começo dos bombardeios, precisaram mudar de local, em média, sete vezes.»

      &8220;246 Journalists and Media Workers Martyred During the Israeli Genocidal War&8221;<br /> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-226658" src="http://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/621321321323.webp" alt="621321321323" />

    <p>
      <b data-darkreader-inline-color="">Ramallah– Gaza–</b><span data-darkreader-inline-color=""> The Palestinian Journalists’ Syndicate strongly condemned the continued systematic policy of the Israeli occupation forces in targeting journalists, killing them, and committing successive massacres against them and their families, which has led to the martyrdom of 246 journalists and media workers.</span>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <span data-darkreader-inline-color="">The Syndicate stated that <strong>the occupation killed 246 journalists and media workers, including 33 female journalists, up until August 26, 2024. Among them was one journalist from the West Bank, colleague Ibrahim Mahameed, who was martyred in February 2024</strong>. The occupation continues to deliberately target Palestinian journalists and their families, particularly in the Gaza Strip, where at least 520 journalists have been injured by Israeli bullets and missiles since October 7, 2023, while no fewer than 800 family members of journalists have been killed in Gaza.</span>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <span data-darkreader-inline-color="">Moreover, more than 800 journalists in Gaza continue to live under conditions of repeated displacement from the north to the south of the Strip, facing severe hardships including lack of safety due to Israeli airstrikes on their tents, the absence of basic living conditions, and the lack of electricity and internet necessary to continue their work.</span>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <span data-darkreader-inline-color="">According to documentation by the Syndicate in cooperation with prisoners’ institutions, <strong>206 cases of arrest and detention of journalists by Israeli occupation authorities</strong> have been recorded since October 2023. Key facts regarding imprisoned journalists include:</span>
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <u><span data-darkreader-inline-color=""><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">55</span>  journalists remain under detention in Israeli prisons, including 5 journalists who had already been imprisoned prior to October 7, 2023.</span></u>
      </li>
      <li>
        <u><span data-darkreader-inline-color="">The occupation has arrested 18 female journalists; only one remains imprisoned, colleague Farah Abu Ayash from Beit Ummar in Hebron, who is held in solitary confinement in Moskobiya.</span></u>
      </li>
      <li>
        <u><span data-darkreader-inline-color="">39 journalists from Gaza have been arrested since October 7, 2023; 22 remain in detention to date.</span></u>
      </li>
      <li>
        <u><span data-darkreader-inline-color=""><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">48</span>  cases of administrative detention have been recorded among Palestinian journalists since the beginning of the genocidal war; 23 remain under administrative detention.</span></u>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      <span data-darkreader-inline-color="">The Syndicate emphasized that the occupation continues to pursue a policy of enforced disappearance against Palestinian journalists, most notably through its refusal to disclose any information regarding the fate of colleagues Nidal Al-Wahidi and Haitham Abdul Wahid, constituting a fully-fledged crime of enforced disappearance in clear violation of international law, international humanitarian law, and the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance adopted by the United Nations and in force since 2010.</span>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <span data-darkreader-inline-color="">As part of its war on the media and its attempt to silence the truth, the Israeli occupation forces have carried out widespread airstrikes and tank assaults that destroyed 115 media institutions in the Gaza Strip, encompassing all types of media outlets. In the West Bank and Jerusalem, they have shut down 5 media institutions and destroyed or closed 12 printing presses.</span>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <span data-darkreader-inline-color="">The Palestinian Journalists’ Syndicate reaffirmed its commitment to continue working with all international human rights and journalistic bodies to seek protection for journalists from the crimes of the occupation, ensure accountability and justice, and to stop the Israeli genocidal war against Palestinian journalists and the press—during which the Israeli occupation has committed the largest massacre of journalists in history.</span>

      Palestinian Journalists’ Syndicate Reveals Dangerous Motives Behind Israel’s Assassination of 31 Female Journalists Since the Outbreak of the Genocidal War

            <strong data-end="236" data-start="223"><span data-darkreader-inline-color=""><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-226659" src="http://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Palestinian-Journalists-Syndicate.png" alt="Palestinian-Journalists-Syndicate" />Ramallah—</span></strong><span data-darkreader-inline-color=""> The Palestinian Journalists’ Syndicate (PJS) revealed that 31 female journalists, along with dozens of female media activists, have been killed since the beginning of Israel’s assault on October 7, 2023, up to early September 2025. The Syndicate stressed that most of the martyrs were killed inside their homes along with family members in crimes that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.</span>
          </p>
          
          <p data-end="1026" data-start="642">
            <span data-darkreader-inline-color="">In a report issued by the Freedoms Committee, the Syndicate indicated that the Israeli occupation deliberately targets Palestinian women journalists—particularly those working in digital media and international outlets such as Anadolu, Al Jazeera Mubasher, Associated Press, and Russia Today—in order to silence the Palestinian female voice and erase documented facts on the ground.</span>
          </p>
          
          <p data-end="1469" data-start="1028">
            <span data-darkreader-inline-color="">The Committee added that this systematic targeting creates an irreparable void in Palestinian female human capital in the media sector, specifically targeting the younger generation of female journalists in their twenties and thirties. The policy, it noted, also aims to intimidate both local and international media circles, transforming the journalist from a “witness to the crime” into a “victim within the crime” along with her family.</span>
          </p>
          
          <p data-end="1907" data-start="1471">
            <span data-darkreader-inline-color="">The Syndicate further reported that in most documented cases, the occupation deliberately killed female journalists while bombing their homes. Six female journalists, however, were killed while performing field reporting duties. These crimes, the Syndicate emphasized, deliberately attack family and societal dimensions, as well as alternative digital media through which female journalists expose violations and crimes on the ground.</span>
