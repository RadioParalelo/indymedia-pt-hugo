WE’LL NEVER STOP: 9 More Ships Now 140 Nautical Miles from Gaza.

The mission continues! Despite the illegal abduction of the Global Sumud Flotilla crew, a powerful new fleet is now critically close to the shores of Gaza.

This collaborative fleet, a union of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition (@gazafreedomflotilla) and Thousand Madleens to Gaza (@thousandmadleenstogaza), is sailing with nearly 150 people from 30 countries. They are just 140 nautical miles from Gaza right now.

The world is their witness. Follow the live tracker now to see all nine boats in real-time on the Freedom Flotilla website and share this message widely.

Stop the Genocide. Keep your eyes on Gaza.

Our flotilla is now within 150 nautical miles of Gaza’s coast, nearing the zone where earlier Freedom Flotilla Coalition and Global Sumud Flotilla missions faced attacks from Israel. Keep your eyes on our flotilla but do not lose focus of what is happening in Gaza. Tag media and politicians to end their enabling and protection of Israel&#8217;s crimes NOW.

For decades, Israel’s occupation, apartheid, ethnic cleansing, and relentless violence has been funded and shielded by governments, corporations, and international institutions. We refuse to be silent. To move forward, the world must confront oppression in its full reality &#8211; colonialism is not a relic of the past, but an ongoing system.

We, the FFC and TMTG, sail against Israel’s brutality and fear tactics. As we quickly approach the interception zone, we ask you to raise awareness by tagging your governments and representatives, and demand they act to not only keep the flotilla safe, but to end Israel&#8217;s impunity and genocidal campaign immediately.

By July this year, 1,581 Palestinian healthcare workers in Gaza had been killed by Israel since Oct 7 (OHCHR). The Israeli military has also abducted more than 360 medical personnel, with at least four dying in custody due to torture and medical neglect (Palestine Centre for Prisoners’ Studies). Israel also continues to block most international medics from entering Gaza and to deny the delivery of vital medical supplies.

Our flotilla sails for a world where hospitals and healthcare workers are no longer targets. The ‘Conscience’ is now days away from Gaza, carrying international medics ready to provide urgent care to Palestinians.
