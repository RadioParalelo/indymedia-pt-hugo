A quick look to some of the manifestation on the Internationale women&#8217;s rights fight day.

While hundreds of thousands of people have marched around the world, shouting and demanding women&#8217;s just right to exist in safety, with dignity and freedom, in some countries they don&#8217;t even have the right to speak. To work as they wish, to move around, to live free from fear and tears.

That&#8217;s why we have to fight. Stay aware, point up !

# Turkey {.wp-block-heading}<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="http://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/8march-Turquie2024-9655881.mp4"></video></figure> 

&#8220;&#8221;Turkish police have intervened in the Istanbul University students’ march held for International Women’s Day allegedly over a banner reading “LGBTIQ+,” and detained many of them. The police attacked the students coming out of the faculty gate and detained them with methods amounting to torture.&#8221;&#8221; https://www.youtube.com/embed/p16JgZQzjZA

&#8220;&#8221;In 2023, the Taliban further intensified its oppressive policies toward women, girls, the LGBTIQ+ community, and religious minorities. [Including] a ban on girls attending secondary schools and universities.(…) Lesbian, bisexual, and transgender women face severe threats, including torture, sexual violence, forced marriage,  
and death.&#8221;&#8221; https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa11/7801/2024/en/

&#8220;&#8221;The Paris demonstration for women&#8217;s rights and equality with men was overwhelmed by jostling between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel activists. Scuffles broke out between the two groups. According to journalists on the scene, it was activists from &#8220;Nous vivrons&#8221;, an sionist association set up after the Hamas attack on Israel, and demonstrators waving Palestinian flags who were fighting. Women from &#8220;Nous vivrons&#8221;, who had come to remember the women killed by Hamas, were removed from the demonstration by the police. &#8220;&#8221;

&#8220;While some are celebrating historic steps taken in countries like Mexico, which is [slated to elect a woman as president][10] for the first time, others are railing against potential rollbacks on rights they’ve long fought for in places like Argentina with the arrival of [far-right President Javier Milei][11]. (…) [Since taking office in December][12],  
Milei has shuttered both the country’s women’s affairs ministry and the  
national anti-discrimination agency, and on Wednesday told high school  
students in a speech that “abortion is murder.”

# Pakistan  {.wp-block-heading}

&#8220;Pakistani authorities have refused to allow a rally in Lahore which aimed to mark the International Women&#8217;s day. Organizers and participants have been accused of displaying &#8220;controversial&#8221; banners. On the other hand, authorities have allowed &#8220;Haya&#8221; march which calls for preservation of Islamic values.&#8221; <https://www.youtube.com/embed/LckbqSBsIL0>

Those controversial banners, accused to promote occidental lifestyle, were claiming for equal rights, stopping homophobic politics, free of speech, etc.<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">

During the Women&#8217;s Day demonstration in Lisbon, two women wearing Climaximo waistcoats smashed the windows of Banco Santander Totta with harmer and spike, for &#8220;consciously financing climate collapse&#8221;. Through the pressure of dozens of people around them, screaming slogans, they were released.
